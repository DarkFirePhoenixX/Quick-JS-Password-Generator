# Quick-JS-Password-Generator
 <br>
 JavaScript generator with multiple different algorithms to quickly create truly unique and strong password. 
 <br>
 The app features 2 main functionalities:
<ul>
 <li>Create a strong and unique password from a seed (text, sentence, whole paragraph, numbers, symbols, etc.)</li>
 <li>Offer to download and save the password in a file with a reminder for its use</li>
</ul>

# Dependencies:

<ul>
 <li>JavaScript should be enabled in your browser</li>
</ul>

# Usage:
   1. First, focus on the "Enter your custom string for generation" field.
   2. Inside it, you can write whatever you like - it can really be anything e.g. word, a sentence, even entire book pages as well as numbers and symbols.
   3. Next, choose your password complexity level (higher level activates the last algorithm, making the password even stronger).
   4. Next, select the password length that is suitable for you.
   5. Lastly, select what you will be using the password for. (Optional. This is only for your reminder, if you want to export the password to a file)
   6. Click the "Generate password" button to generate the new password, which will appear in the "Hashed password" field. (You can click as many times as you like until you are happy with your generated password)
   7. Now you can copy it like that and save it however you like, or you can click "Export password to file" button and your password will be saved to your device in a file with the reminder you have used earlier in step 5.
   8. If you wish to reset and try again a new password, you can click the "Reset generator" button.
